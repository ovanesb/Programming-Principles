# S.O.L.I.D (object-oriented design)

<pre>
  - (S) <b>Single responsibility principle</b> : 
  a class should have only a single responsibility 
  (i.e. only one potential change in the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)
  
  - (O) <b>Open/closed principle</b> : 
  software entities(object) â€¦ should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
  
  - (L) <b>Liskov substitution principle</b> : 
  objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
  
  - (I) <b>Interface segregation principle</b> : 
  many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
  
  - (D) <b>Dependency inversion principle</b> : 
  one should depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.
