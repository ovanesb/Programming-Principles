<b>YAGNI</b> - is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary. XP co-founder Ron Jeffries has written: "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them. Other forms of the phrase include "You aren't going to need it"and "You ain't gonna need it"

<br />
Sometimes, as developers, we try to think a lot in the future of the project coding some extra features “just in case we need them” or “we will eventually need them”. Just one word… Wrong!
